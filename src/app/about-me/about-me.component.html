      <div>
        I am a fully trained chef from Switzerland with a rich background in the
        culinary arts. After extensive research to identify the next step in my
        learning journey, I discovered a profound interest in web development.
        This led me to join the Developer Academy, where I uncovered a second
        passion. With a newfound dedication, I have decided to pursue a position
        as a web developer in Zurich. Throughout my culinary career, I have honed
        vital skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity,
        particularly under the high-pressure environment of a busy kitchen. These
        skills translate seamlessly into web development, where they contribute
        significantly to my ability to work collaboratively on technical solutions
        and innovative projects.
